Dear Eduardo,
the NNFW framework version 1.1.5 is very old and not maintained anymore.
The NNFW is now a sub-library of a bigger framework called FARSA.
(http://laral.istc.cnr.it/farsa ).
I'm sorry, but at the moment the only solution for you is to compile
NNFW from sources.
You can still download old sources at this page:
http://laral.istc.cnr.it/laral++/nnfw/downloads.php

Cheers,
Gianluca.
